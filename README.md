## Hey there! I am Dhir Thacker 👋

Welcome to my GitHub! I’m a grad student at Northeastern University, exploring everything from cloud-native systems to AI-powered apps. I love turning messy data into clean solutions and building things that solve real-world problems.

## 🧠 Interests & What I’m Exploring

I love working at the intersection of data systems and intelligence. Right now, I am especially into:
- Generative AI & LLMs (RAG apps, LangChain, Pinecone)
- Cloud-native data engineering with AWS, GCP, and Airflow
- Real-time analytics using Kafka & Spark
- MLOps & scalable ML pipelines

## 🛠️ Tech I'm into

**Languages:** Python, SQL, C++, R, JavaScript  
**Databases:** PostgreSQL, MySQL, MSSQL, Oracle, MongoDB, Cassandra  
**Cloud & Big Data:** AWS (S3, Lambda, EC2, Glue, Redshift), GCP (BigQuery, Dataflow), Airflow, Kafka, Snowflake, Hadoop, Spark  
**ML & AI:** TensorFlow, PyTorch, Scikit-learn, RAG, LangChain, Generative AI, NLP  
**Dashboards & Analytics:** Power BI, Tableau, Looker, Alteryx, Talend  
**DevOps & Tools:** Docker, Kubernetes, Git, Postman, JIRA, VS Code

## 🚀 What I've Built

- **🧠 AIVY – AI Learning Assistant:** A Generative AI app that scrapes, chunks, and retrieves content using OpenAI, Pinecone, and Streamlit.  
- **🚦 CrashStat – Vehicle Collision Analytics:** An ETL and dashboarding project analyzing NYC crash data using Talend, SQL Server, and Power BI.  
- **📈 Sales Forecasting with ML:** Built a time-series forecasting pipeline using ARIMA and XGBoost to predict sales and optimize inventory.  
- **🏋️ KILO – Fitness App:** A mobile app for tracking workouts and yoga postures using PoseNet and Firebase, built with Flutter.
