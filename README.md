## Hey there! I am Dhir Thacker 👋

Welcome to my GitHub! I’m a grad student at Northeastern University, exploring everything from cloud-native systems to AI-powered apps. I love turning messy data into clean solutions and building things that solve real-world problems.

## 🧠 Interests & What I’m Exploring

I love working at the intersection of data systems and intelligence. Right now, I am especially into:
- Generative AI & LLMs (RAG apps, LangChain, Pinecone)
- Cloud-native data engineering with AWS, GCP, and Airflow
- Real-time analytics using Kafka & Spark
- MLOps & scalable ML pipelines
