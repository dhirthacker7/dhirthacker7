# Hey there! I am Dhir Thacker 👋

Welcome to my GitHub! I’m a grad student at Northeastern University, exploring everything from cloud-native systems to AI-powered apps. I love turning messy data into clean solutions and building things that solve real-world problems.

Lately, I’ve been diving into:
- Generative AI & LLMs (think RAG apps, Pinecone, LangChain)
- Cloud data engineering (AWS, GCP, Airflow, Kafka)
- Real-time analytics & dashboarding
- Automating things with Python, SQL, and a bunch of glue code
