Welcome to my GitHub! I’m a grad student at Northeastern University, exploring everything from cloud-native systems to AI-powered apps. I love turning messy data into clean solutions and building things that solve real-world problems.

## 🧠 Interests & What I’m Exploring

I love working at the intersection of data systems and intelligence. Right now, I am especially into:
- Generative AI & LLMs (RAG apps, LangChain)
- Cloud-native data engineering pipelines with AWS, GCP, and Airflow
- Real-time analytics using Kafka & Spark

## 🛠️ Technologies & Tools

- **Languages:** Python, SQL, C++, R, JavaScript  
- **Databases:** PostgreSQL, MySQL, MSSQL, Oracle, MongoDB, Cassandra  
- **Cloud & Big Data:** AWS (S3, Glue, Redshift, Lambda, Kinesis, QuickSight, EC2), GCP, Airflow, Kafka, Snowflake, Hadoop, Spark  
- **ML & AI:** TensorFlow, PyTorch, Scikit-learn, RAG, LangChain, Generative AI, NLP  
- **Dashboards & Analytics:** Power BI, Tableau, Looker, Alteryx, Talend, DImensional modeling  
- **DevOps & Tools:** Docker, Kubernetes, Git, Postman, JIRA, VS Code, Data Governance

## 🚀 What I've Built

- **🧠 AIVY – AI Learning Assistant:** A Generative AI multimodal RAG app that scrapes, chunks, and retrieves content using OpenAI, Pinecone, and Streamlit.  
- **🚦 CrashStat – Vehicle Collision Analytics:** An ETL and dashboarding project analyzing NYC crash data using Talend, SQL Server, and Power BI.  
- **📈 Sales Forecasting with ML:** Built a time-series forecasting pipeline using ARIMA and XGBoost to predict sales and optimize inventory.  
- **🏋️ KILO – Fitness App:** A mobile app for tracking workouts and yoga postures using PoseNet and Firebase, built with Flutter.
